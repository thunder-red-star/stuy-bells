# stuybellz

a small crappy project that is really bad and everyone is better at coding than me :( 

it's a [bell schedule website](https://is-wholeso.me)

## use

`npm i`

`node .`

you might need to set the environment variable for time zone. it's already set to `America/New_York` for your convenience.

## update
when did this blow up? lmao
